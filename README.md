This extension will focus on nouns and adjectives only as they can be isolated and translated directly.

I want to scan the page and identify the nouns and adjectives client side using a library compromise js.

Then, wrap them in a span with a class so I can differentiate them visually later on.

Hover over it to translate it in place using a tooltip and a translation API (un-hover and english will remain). Click it to make the translation permanent. The fact you've done this is saved somewhere. Use some spaced repetition algorithm and eventually the 'learned' words will be replaced automatically on a page (hover to translate back to english).

Pages will eventually be a mix of spanish and english.
